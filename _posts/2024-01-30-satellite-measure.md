**Satellites detect methane leaks by using sensors to capture infrared light reflecting off the Earth's surface. Methane absorbs specific wavelengths of this light, creating a distinct signature that satellites can identify with specialized algorithms. By analyzing this data, scientists can map and visualize methane emissions, track changes over time, and pinpoint sources of leaks.**

Satellites can detect methane leaks using a technique called remote sensing. Here's a simplified explanation of how it works:

#### Spectral Imaging

Satellites equipped with sensors are able to capture images of the Earth's surface. These sensors are capable of detecting different wavelengths of light, including those in the infrared spectrum.

#### Methane Absorption

Methane absorbs specific wavelengths of light in the infrared spectrum. This means that when sunlight hits the Earth's surface and reflects back towards the satellite, the methane in the atmosphere absorbs certain wavelengths of the reflected light.

#### Detection Algorithm

Scientists use algorithms to analyze the data collected by the satellite sensors. These algorithms identify the specific signature of methane absorption in the collected data.

#### Mapping and Visualization 

Once methane leaks are detected and located, the data can be mapped and visualized. This helps identify the sources of methane emissions, such as leaks from oil and gas infrastructure, landfills, agricultural activities, or natural sources like wetlands.

#### Monitoring Over Time

Satellites can make repeated passes over the same area, allowing for continuous monitoring of methane emissions over time. This can help track changes in emissions, identify trends, and assess the effectiveness of mitigation efforts.

Overall, satellite-based methane detection provides a valuable tool for monitoring and managing methane emissions on a global scale, helping to address climate change and air quality concerns.

#### Resources and links for free methane satellite images

**EU Sentinel-5P images**: 
The EU is publishing free images from satellites Sentinel-5P with a dedicated instrument for methane detection called TROPOMI. The Netherlands Space Research Center is crunching those images to detect methane plumes and they publish it every week there https://earth.sron.nl/methane-emissions/.
