**An important paper on Methane removal was published in 2021 by Robert B. Jackson & al. We're reviewing it here. Methane poses a major threat due to its high warming potential and increasing atmospheric concentration. Mitigating emissions is crucial, but uncertainties and potential for sudden releases necessitate additional strategies. Existing research focuses heavily on CO2 removal; a dedicated agenda for methane removal is lacking.**

The article, titled "Atmospheric methane removal: a research agenda", found [there](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsta.2020.0454), argues for the development of technologies to remove methane from the atmosphere, alongside efforts to reduce emissions. Here are the key points:

### The Problem

Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, contributing significantly to global warming. It didn't get as much attention as CO2 because the amount of methane emission is much smaller, but it has a significant impact (for a given amount of gas, it has a greenhouse effect 80 times more potent than CO2).

While reducing emissions is crucial, achieving zero emissions might be impossible, especially in sectors like agriculture.
Sudden, large methane releases are also possible, like from the Arctic with the permafrost releasing it.

### The Solution

Developing methods to remove methane from the atmosphere could be a vital tool for mitigating climate change.
Unlike CO2 removal, there's no established research agenda for methane removal.

### The Call to Action

The authors propose a research agenda for "negative methane emissions," including:
- **Direct removal technologies** Explore methods like chemical or biological capture, filtration, and conversion to CO2.
- **Enhanced natural processes** Investigate stimulating soil bacteria (methanotrophs) to break down atmospheric methane.
- **Modeling and assessment**Develop models to evaluate the effectiveness, scalability, costs, and potential risks of different removal methods.
- **Social and ethical considerations**: Address issues like equity, governance, and potential unintended consequences of methane removal.
- **Integration and deployment:** Plan for integrating removal technologies with mitigation strategies and responsible deployment.

### Key Arguments

Methane removal offers a complementary approach to mitigation, potentially accelerating progress towards climate goals.
While uncertainties exist, proactive research is crucial to develop safe and effective methods before urgent needs arise.
Early investment can overcome technical challenges and ensure responsible development and deployment.

### Conclusion

The article emphasizes the urgency of action due to the accelerating growth of atmospheric methane.
It acknowledges the potential limitations of specific removal methods and highlights the need for a diverse portfolio.
The authors call for international collaboration and open communication to ensure research progress and responsible governance.
By delving deeper into these points, you can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the article's arguments and the proposed research agenda for tackling the critical challenge of atmospheric methane.
